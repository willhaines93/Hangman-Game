# Hangman-Game
This Hangman Game was a python program that I had created for a final project for my grade 11 computer science course. The project was created three years or so before this repo was created, however I just wanted to upload all of my past projects to have them all on github.

The program is a hangman game created using pygame. It allows the user to pick from three different categories and gives the player a hint as to what the answer might be. It is a fairly simple program and was created to learn about the implemntation of functions in a larger scale program.
